# rx-message-poll

An example of using RxJava to periodically poll a remote service.
Demonstrated:

* The service returns a JSON array of data which we coalesce into a stream of individual items.
* Filtering streams.
* Handling connection errors.
* De-duplicating data.
* Unit testing the polling mechanism.

The code is written in Java 8 and the tests with http://docs.spockframework.org/[Spock]. The example relies on https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava[RxJava], http://square.github.io/retrofit/[Retrofit] and the https://www.mockaroo.com/api/docs[Mockaroo] web service.

## Running the example

----
./gradlew run
----

The example requires an internet connection and an API key for Mockaroo. Create a `gradle.properties` file that looks like this:

[source,properties]
----
mockaroo.api.key=xxxxxx
----

## Running the tests

----
./gradlew test
----

The tests do not require any internet connection or access to Mockaroo.
